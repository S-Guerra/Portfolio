                    <h2>How I embarked on this journey</h2>
                    <p>
                        After suffering an injury last year that left me with two broken legs, I decided to use my recovery time to explore a new field: front-end development.<br /><br />
                        With the encouragement and support of a dear friend and my passion for problem-solving, I quickly found front-end development to be a captivating and enjoyable challenge, approaching each problem as a fun and exciting puzzle.<br /><br />
                        I have almost completed my self-taught training and am eager to start working in this fascinating field. I am thrilled to be able to combine my creativity with my technical skills to bring innovative solutions to my future employers.<br />
